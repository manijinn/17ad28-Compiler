# 17ad28-Compiler
I worked on this project with a teammate. It is a full compiler in the educational PL0 language. Previously in this class (where I was assigned this project), we desgined our own stack machines, lexers, and syntax analyzers. However for this assignment, the professor gave us pre-made stack machines, lexers, and syntax analyzers, but had to design the code generation part. Thus this is a full compiler.

I have included the stack machines, lexers, and syntax analyzers that my teammate and I have amde for the earlier assignments however.
